			<h1> About Me </h1>
			<p> <img src="images/profile.jpg" width="100"> Hi, my name is Amanda, but you can call me GAX. That's short for my surname, Gacutan. I attended all-girls catholic school from grade school all the way up to my senior high where I took the STEM strand. For college, I decided to take up Multimedia due to its high demand in today's corporate word. This was no issue for me as I enjoyed graphic design as well as trying new forms of art. Another bonus was my personal issues with graphic design and signages in the philippines.

			<p>I find it hard to read signs here as the english translation often times differ from what the sign really means. I remember having to take an MRT to go to the hotel my dad was working at. I had to get the bags checked and the sign said "place laptops and other large electronics devices in the yellow tray." Being the good citizen I was, I opened up my bag and took out my laptop when a guard stopped me and said I had to put the entire bag in the bin. This caused the line to be held up and since then, I had a mission to make the Philippines' signages better and easier to understand for both its local citizens and foreigners. </p>
